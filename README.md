# WakeLight

Personal project to create an automated light that functions as an alarm clock. 
The project is based on the Arduino platform and uses Adafruit Neopixel and RTClib - libraries.
The project is currently not finished and I plan to add features in the future. 

The system uses an Arduino Nano as the microcontroller and a DS3231- realtime clock for timekeeping. 
A strip of WS2812b is used as LEDs.

TODO: 
	Add ability to change time without reprogramming the microcontroller
	Add display to show time and alarm state
